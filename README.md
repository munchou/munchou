### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working: no.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: yes, until Death does me. And yes, that's disgusting.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate: yes.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: the understanding of the Universe and Life.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: things I'm able to answer. That'll be a good start.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me a message, perhaps? A pigeon will do, too. I only eat super fat ones.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: wrong place to learn about pronouns. For that, there is a place called "school". I heard it can be quite harsh and stressful, but don't quote me on this, I skipped it.
- âš¡ Fun fact: go to your favorite search engine and type "fun fatcs". First it'll show you that you mispelled "facts" (had you noticed?), next it'll display you results that'll do a better job than I would. Glory to the Internet, right?
