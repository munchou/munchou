### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<i>last update: 9th of May, 2025</i>


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working: no, but I want to.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: yes, until Death does me. Hahaaaaaa!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate: yes.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: the understanding of the Universe and Life.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: things I'm able to answer. That'll be a good start.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me a message, perhaps? A pigeon will do, too. I only eat super fat ones.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: wrong place to learn about pronouns. For that, there is a place called "school". I heard it can be quite harsh and stressful, but don't quote me on this, I skipped it.
- âš¡ Fun fact: go to your favorite search engine and type "fun fatcs". First it'll show you that you mispelled "facts" (had you noticed?), next it'll display you results that'll do a better job than I would. Glory to the Internet, right?

    <a href="https://www.planetofthedevz.com"><img src="/_github_images/planetofthedevz.png"/></a><br/>
    My greatest project so far: a web-app exclusively for developers without any professional experience and companies looking for them!<br>
    Finished and functional. Took 2 months, from half December 2023 to half February 2024.<br>
    Made in Python (Django), PostgreSQL database, encrypted e-mails in the DB, files upload (images automatically resized + CV in PDF), contact form (SMTP, no e-mail info), profiles randomly displayed on the feed to be fair to everyone, etc.<br>
    Deployed on a VPS running on Ubuntu and Nginx.

    <a href="https://github.com/munchou/palindrome-or-not"><img src="/_github_images/palindrome_checker.png"/></a><br/>
    Ever wondered if the word or sentence you were looking at was a palindrome? Search no more! That daily question can now be easily answered! What's more, you can choose if you want to skip spaces, punctuation and digits!<br/>
    Damn, 2024 is ending well in the world of I.T.

<p align="center">
    <a href="https://github.com/munchou/hangman-game"><img src="/_github_images/hangman_game.png"/></a><br/>
    Totally playable. 2 languages: English and French. Still in progress, probably finished soon. Possibility to manually add words.<br/>
    For the English version: word retriever -> allows the user to retrieve words' definitions from dictionary.cambridge.org manually or from a file (in which words are added manually, one word per line).<br/>
    To avoid weird/unusual words, I absolutely discourage from automating such an important task...
